\subsection{Single-Trial Regression and Multiple Comparison Correction using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement \textcolor{green}{Lukas, Marius, Klaus}}
% - mass univariate regression at the single subject level (Kutas rERP, Groppe, Pernet, Cavanagh, Cohen). Averaging betas and pvals, then do tfce transform on the mean and infer on the tfce statistic? \todo{check if this method correct, how did cohen do it?}
% - paired ttest with bootstrap-tfce multiple comparison correction \citep{SMITH200983} to make inferences about the interaction
% - Grand Average Statistics
