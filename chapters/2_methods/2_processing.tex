\subsection{EEG Preprocessing and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) \textcolor{green}{Lukas, Marius, Klaus}}
EEG data preprocessing and ICA were performed with Matlab 2019b (MATLAB, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), using the EEGLAB toolbox \cite{Delorme2004a} and our 'BeMoBIL Pipeline' scripts and functions. The single subject data was lowpass filtered with 124Hz and down-sampled to 250Hz. Channels which were contaminated with artifacts were automatically rejected using the PREP pipeline \cite{Bigdely-Shamlo2015} 'FindNoisyChannel' function, which is selecting bad channels by amplitude, the signal to noise ratio and correlation with other channels. Rejected channels were then interpolated while ignoring the EOG channel, and finally re-referenced to average reference (data A). The data was then filtered with a 1 Hz highpassfilter (data B), a first adaptive mixture independent component analysis, AMICA \cite{Palmer2011}, was used to identify eye related independent components (ICs) which were projected out of the sensor data (data A). For this, the rank was reduced by one for average reference use and further by the number of interpolated channels in the respective data set. To identify eye components IClabel  \cite{Pion-Tonachini2019} was used, whereas components exceeding a value of 0.7 for the 'eye' class were defined as eye components. Then, to detect segments of noisy data, an automated time domain cleaning (see \citet{Gramann2018}) on the time domain was performed on narrowly filtered data from 1 to 40 Hz. The data was therefore first split into 1 second long segments for which the mean absolute amplitude and standard deviation of all channels as well as the Mahalanobis distance of all channel mean amplitudes were calculated. All three methods results were then joined together in order to rank all segments. The 12\% highest ranking noisy segments were selected for rejection and an additional buffer of $+/-$ 0.49 sec was added around each segment resulting in about 15\% rejected data for each subject. This data was rejected from data B and a second AMICA was calculated on this time domain cleaned data. A dipole fitting procedure was performed for each spatial filter using the 10-20 standard electrode locations and a boundary element head model (BEM) based on the MNI brain (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI, Montreal, QC, Canada). The spatial filter information was then copied back to the preprocessed, interpolated and average referenced data set (data A). Ultimatelty, all ICs with a 'brain' probability smaller than .5 as indicated by ICLabel were projected out of the data resulting in the final dataset of likely brain sources and their projections to the channels.

\subsection{Event-related Feature Extraction}
Data was epoched -3 to +2 seconds around the 600 \textit{cube selection} events and trials were removed (a) if the reaction time between cube \textit{spawn} and \textit{selection} exceeded two seconds or (b) large voltage fluctuations in the channels were detected via EEGLABs \textit{autorej} function. On average X trials were removed. % todo how many trials were removed 
For each remaining single trial we built event-related potentials for channels and independent components (ERP), event-related velocities, i.e. the magnitude of velocities in x, y and z direction (ERV) as well as event-related time-frequency decompositions (ERSP). Time-frequency decomposition were computed via the \textit{newtimef} function in EEGLAB for 3 to 80 Hz in logarithmic scale, using a wavelet transformation with 3 cycles for the lowest frequency and a linear increase with frequency of 0.5 cycles. Single-trial baseline vectors contained average power per frequency bin in the -200 to 0 ms window preceding cube \textit{spawns}. Where applicable, grand average ERSPs are computed by first averaging both trial data and baselines across trials in power then dividing trial data by baseline and transforming the outcome to logarithmic scaling. ERPs are plotted after bandpass filtering with a low and high cutoff at 0.1 and 15 Hz respectively.

\subsection{Classifier, Classifier Scalp Projections and Localization of Components relevant to Classification}
Following \citet{Zander2016} a regularized linear discriminant analysis classifier was trained per participant with all asynchronous trials constituting class 1 and a random sample of an equal size of synchronous trials labeled class 2. Using Matlab 2014a (MATLAB, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) with the open-source toolbox BCILAB ver. 1.4 the classifier was trained on windowed means as features. Therefore, average amplitudes of all channels and eight sequential 50 ms time windows between 50 and 450 ms following \textit{cube selection} were extracted following resampling to 100 Hz and band-pass filtering from 0.1 to 15 Hz. For robust performance estimation, a 5 x 5 nested cross-validation was used to calculate the classifiers reliability. Classification accuracy was statistically evaluated using a two-sample ttest with the mean classifier accuracy per participant across folds and simulated chance level given trial numbers in each class \cite{Muller-Putz2007}.

In order to learn what regions of the brain the classifier specifically relied on, we first transformed the LDA filters at each time window to LDA patterns reflecting a mixture of scalp activations with regards to the discriminative source activity \cite{Haufe2014a, Zander2016, Krol2019}. Subsequently, the relevance for classification can be computed using LDA filter weights per time window and the ICA umixing matrix. The equivalent current dipole models of independent compontents were then weighted by their relevance and ultimately visualized via EEGLAB dipoleDensity plots. We established the highest relevance voxel via visual inspection and used it as a seed region of interest (ROI) for group-level IC clustering. % maybe add movie for supplement material

\subsection{Clustering Independent Components for Group-Level Analyses}
To allow for group-level analyses across independent components, we clustered components based on their equivalent dipole locations (weight=6), grand-average ERSPs (weight=3), mean log spectra (weight=1), and scalp topography (weight=1), using a region of interest (ROI) driven repetitive k-means clustering approach \cite{Gramann2018}. The weighted IC measures were summed and compressed using PCA, resulting in a 10-dimensional feature vector for clustering. ICs were clustered by applying the k-means algorithm with k equaling the median number of ICs retained across subjects. ICs with a distance of more than three standard deviations from any final centroid mean were considered outliers. To ensure replicability of the clustering, we employed the same clustering approach reported in \cite{Gramann2018}. After applying desirable weights (number of participants: 2, ICs/participants: -2, spread: -1, RV: -1, distance from ROI: -2, Mahalanobis distance from the median: -1) the final clustering solution contained the ICs from X participants, a ratio of X ICs per participant, a spread of X, a mean RV of X\%, and a distance of X units in the MNI space for the cluster of primary interest.
