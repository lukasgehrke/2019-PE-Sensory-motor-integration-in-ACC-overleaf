results to report:

- behavioral adaptation -> is the rate of change in action time dependent on presenting a mismatch? is it amplified in the vibrotactile condition (interaction)? Using action time, can we predict match/mismatch?

[plot] plot_erp of movement velocity curve with avg. detection markers to explain 'action time'
    - separate lines for vibrotactile and baseline?

- main effect ERP at FCz? -> ERP classification using windowed means and all channels as features

[plot] ERP at FCz with plot_erp, control signal at window(s?) plotted for source localization

- source localization results, name ROI coordinates

[plot] dipoleDensity and scalp map for one select time window (see above) or average over windows. Add other time windows to Appendix

[- post-hoc analysis (high resolution explorative view on cluster): clustering to midline cingulate sources -> spectral response of midcingulate sources to oddball and haptics + interaction, report location and effect size of significant clusters]

[plot] cluster dipoleDensity, scalp map [and the sig. masked ERSP]
