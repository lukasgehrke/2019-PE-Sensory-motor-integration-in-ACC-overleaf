\section{Results \& Statistical Analyses}

% TODO
% describe behavioral results
% 1. descriptives of the reaching movement, avg/sd reaction time from spawn to reach, reach vel, action time
% 2. descriptives of action time, then statistics of rate of change in action time -> need to have hypothesis about that!!! why would this change -> this must go into the intro
% -> action time affected by match/mismatch modulation but not added vibrotactile haptics -> stats of the lme
% 3. predictive power using rate of change and glme to predict match/mismatch occurrence

% ERP/LDA classification
% [x] 1. grand average ERP at FCz / Cz with sig. test of main contrast of match/mismatch?
% 2. LDA classification accuracy over all trials
% 3. IC Source localization of classifier

\subsection{Spatio-temporal asynchrony and post-error slowing}

In the synchronous trials, participants reached the target on average after 1.04 (sd = .19) seconds following the spawn on the table at one of three possible location. Increasing the collider size by a factor of 3.5 resulted, as expected, in a shortened reaction time of .73 (sd = .12) seconds, see figure \ref{setup_and_behavior} D. Hence in manipulated trials, an asynchrony of ~300ms led to a perturbed spatio-temporal congruence. The velocity profile in both conditions exhibited a narrow peak during outward reaching with a peak magnitude of ~.6 m/s and a broader and lower peak retracting the hand, \ref{setup_and_behavior} C top.

% Frage: wenn vel profiles mit movement onset aligned dann sollten evtl. kurven gleich sein, es sei denn es gibt einen "kontinuierlichen" rekalibrationseffekt ist in den syncs. mit drin
% im idealfall ist der rekalibrationseffekt 1/4 der 300ms
% Optimierungsprozess um den RMSE bei rekalibration zu optimieren
% mallot VR noise adaptation

The addition of a haptic sensation while touching the virtual objects (by means of vibrotactile stimulation) led participants to generally move their hand slower during the whole trial, see \ref{setup_and_behavior} C middle row. Participants started their outward movement earlier and their outward peak magnitude was lower when approaching the target (for example at 50 ms preceding object selection, $t_{18} = -2.14, P = .03$). Following trials with spatio-temporal asynchrony, movement behavior was altered in the next trial. An earlier movement onset with a broader peak and immediate retraction following object select was observed (for example at 100 following object selection, $t_{18} = -17.24, P = 0$). Taken together, the task introduced spatio-temporal asynchrony, with rendered vibrotactile feedback as well as the asynchrony impacting future reaching movement characteristics.
