\section{Discussion @ALL}

% discussion points:
% - reference to self and body ownership, spatial computations between egocentric and allocentric? cite Ehrsson work
% - usage in online BCI applications detecting glitches etc., see CHI work, Zander, Blankertz
% - is proprioceptive feedback important in our task: I'd argue against that because I consider vibration on the fingertip to be an exteroceptive sensation and do not consider it relevant where the hand was and how my joints were angled etc. during the mismatch event, therefore i stick to exteroceptive prediction errors only!

% add towards the end of the current subsection:
% On world stability: designing visuo-haptic mismatches in virtual environments means further complicating the action-perception cycle understood as hypothesis testing. By pseudo-randomizing when one of the 25 percent chance oddballs appears, hypothesis testing and subsequent evaluation of the latent variables causing the oddball to appear becomes meaningless. Therefore, we
