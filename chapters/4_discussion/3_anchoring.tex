\subsection{Self-anchoring spatial reference frames}
% summary of discussion part:
% - describe necessity to understand where body parts are located in peripersonal space
% - anchoring the body part only works in reference to other objects (allocentric), what is the egocentric perspective?
% - link back to introduction about: %Parietal areas, as a location of arising alpha rhythms have been frequently linked to anchoring the bodily self during action-perception being ideally located for integration of spatial reference frames \cite{Blanke2015, Guterstam2015a, Halgren2019}. Further, connections to the hippocampus via retrosplenial cortices implicate a role in spatio-temporal context situating and reproduction \cite{Pearson2011, Clark2018, Gramann2009, Friston2016a}.
