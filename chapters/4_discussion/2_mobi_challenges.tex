% discuss reasons for low R^2 and approaches to address it (experiment design and methods (unfolding other processes, adding regressors etc.)) 
% is there a meta study on effect sizes in timefrequency resolved EEG studies. What does Johanna report, regarding effect size?

\subsection{Challenges and opportunities investigating free moving navigators}
Energy of the stimulus 

\subsubsection{Time-locked vs. continuous regressors/stimuli}
\subsubsection{EEG artifacts due to movement}
\subsubsection{Contrast desktop stimulation vs. wide FOV in VR}
\subsubsection{Higher cortical noise}
\subsubsection{Saliency of stimulus, necessary attention on stimulus} %in terms of predictive coding
\subsubsection{Study specific shortcomings}
low N, both in subjects and in trials due to oddball paradigm
