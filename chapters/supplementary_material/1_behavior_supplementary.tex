\subsection{Prolonged `Action time' Following VR Glitches: Leveraging all trials for classification}

Subjecting all trials to the classification scheme, here we report results using the same analysis as in the behavioral part of the results section. Since we leveraged a 75\% to 25\% match to mismatch ratio this increased the amount of data significantly.

`Action time', the hand movement period from movement start to reaching the object, lasted on average .75s (SD = .15) in match- and .69s (SD = .15) in mismatch trials. 

We calculated the \textit{rate of change} in `action time' as a metric of post-error slowing. Following match trials, `action time' in the subsequent trial did not change, i.e. 0s (SD = .01). However, following mismatch trials, `action time' was increased in the subsequent trial on average by .05s (SD = .04); this modulation was about 67 times more likely to occur under the model considering mismatch modulation than the null model (equivalent ${\chi}^2_{(1)} = 67.5, p<.001$), see figure \ref{setup_and_behavior}c.

Using the trial-to-trial adaptation in `action time', trial classes (match/mismatch) were classified with an average within-subject classification accuracy across folds of 67\% (SD = 2.2), exceeding the significance threshold of the simulated chance level at 61.1\% (SD = 0.01, $t_{(18)} = 10.2, p < .001$.
