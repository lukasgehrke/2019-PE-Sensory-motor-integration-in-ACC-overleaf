What is this useful for?
first peak into spatial cognition in naturally exploring human participants
Pipeline introduced here advancing MoBI research
towards describing informative features of hinting at spatial orientedness to measure successful therapeutic intervention of affected patient populations as well as open up usage in neuroadaptive technologies

For the results we can reuse the presented work in SC2018 and only reproduce duration and use SC2018 citation for velocity and number of touches.
Then we go into EEG with duration (for spectrum), iti (for ERSP) and meanratings as the main focus combining everything.
