In this paper we take a macroscopic perspective to spatial learning and its EEG correlates in a spatial navigation paradigm allowing physical free moving exploration behavior in human participants.

We broke down the ongoing information stream during spatial navigation to discrete atoms of spatial thought. This touch moment is one moment of sampling the spatial surroundings equalling fixations, smells, etc. in other everyday navigation scenarios.
