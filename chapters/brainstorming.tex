\section{Introduction}

very briefly summarize main behavioral findings, cite behavioral summary in sc paper, then go on to cite preprint stating that it contains a shorter summary of the longer results in SC paper and may interest the reader.

summarize Mean Ratings, Duration, Touches and Distance-covered between touches map as behavioral results. Refer to statistical results given in preprint?

Then present EEG findings of the one main cluster of interest, power spectrum ANOVA and regression as well as ERSP ANOVA and regression

Argumentation:
Show that ITI (Inter touch Interval) correlates:
with the location in the maze (low ITI in corners / high ITI along straight segments)
if TRUE: make heatmap with CDATA of ITI (cold color = high ITI, warm color = low ITI)
with the amount of heading change (heading changes vs. maintaining heading)
Single-trial regression of ITI in ERSP controlling for touch duration and run (ignore study design) since run causes a decrease in ITI.
Summarize group-level average (can simply average across betas since ITI is zscored) across subjects and check if TFCE statistic is significant
Do that for different clusters (test if response between clusters differ?), RSC - parietal - occipital
