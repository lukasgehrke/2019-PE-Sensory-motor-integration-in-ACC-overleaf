\subsection{Limitations}
% TODO:
% [] summarize limitations arising from previous sections and align with our work
% [] assume frontal evaluation of asynchronoy guiding future action and therefore did bot correlate any EEG metric with a post-error slowing parameter.
% [x] discuss why reaction time was excluded for behavioral adaptation!
% [] discuss why eye sources remain after ICLabel selection
% [] is classification success dependent on level of haptic immersion? -> cite that it also works better in meditators for example

\subsection{Conclusions \& Outlook}
We believe that this is a first step towards a potential metric for visuo-haptic immersion based on detecting visuo-haptic mismatches. 

% this and si-mohammed are already follow up studies that have further confirmed the feasability
If follow up studies replicate the reported patterns of ERP modulation based on sensory mismatch, VR research will benefit four-fold: (1) evaluating haptic immersion via ERPs does not require interrupting the user’s immersive experience to ask questions. (2) The latter will further enable to conduct background evaluations of the user’s sense of haptic immersion, enabling new paradigms for user studies in VR (using implicit measures). (3) ERPs are not subject to the same degree of introspection as the standard pres- ence questionnaires. (4) This technique can be used as the building-block for VR applications that want to automatically adjust to the user’s perception of conflicts, e.g., using our approach, an application could automatically adjust collision detection.

% In general, the classifiers appears to have relied on the MMN, since the control signal separation mimicks the MMN time course, see figure~\ref{erp} and~\ref{lda_loc}. This is in line with the finding of~\citet{Zander2016-ed} who report a high similarity between the level of `prediction violation' and the ERP-weighted-by-classifier time course.

% [] Further, additional contrasts with self-report would be good as well. The Authors may want to consider touching on the differences or validity of the immersion and presence constructs for VR interaction.
