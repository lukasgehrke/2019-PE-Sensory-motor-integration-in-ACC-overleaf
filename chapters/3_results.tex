\section{Results \& Statistical Analyses}

\subsection{Hierarchical linear modeling}
\subsubsection{Mass univariate modeling}
mass univariate regression at the single subject level (Kutas rERP, Groppe, Pernet, Cavanagh, Cohen). Averaging betas and pvals, then do tfce transform on the mean and infer on the tfce statistic? \todo{check if this method correct, how did cohen do it?}
\subsubsection{Group level inference and its multiple comparison correction}
paired ttest with bootstrap-tfce multiple comparison correction \citep{SMITH200983} to make inferences about the interaction

\subsection{Hand movement impacts error processing in independent anterior EEG sources}
\todo{add here the mean betas of velocity and acceleration}

\subsection{Interaction effect}
In haptically richer environments, processing gets more accurate and hence amplifies the error signal originating in or near anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moving fast and experiencing richer haptic feedback impact error processing
