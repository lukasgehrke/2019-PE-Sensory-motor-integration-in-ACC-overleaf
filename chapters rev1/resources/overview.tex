Experimental Paradigm
extended task description -> cite / take from SC paper
videos
make a cool new one
upload with description
Behavioral Analyses
sketchmaps boxplot
mocap parameters boxplots
Touch duration proofs
(does not change as a function of trialrun, maze or wallchange)
modeled as a predictor without interaction term in RLM of single subject ERSP estimation
show and explain in regression terms grand average touch duration rERSP
show histogram / raincloud of touch durations per subject
Proof of timewarp “okayness”
erpimage power values across bands sorted by touch duration
addressed by adding as regression term on single trial regression of touch duration, see above
citations
Addressing Artifacts
show spectrum peaks and how they were addressed by baseline correction and reporting only differences between experimental manipulations
apply above LIMO method also to a cluster of potential eye as well as neck muscle cluster and show linear relation with behavioral parameters as done above for brain clusters
Addressing potential reviewer comments
is spatial learning actually occurring? How to prove it without pointing, RVD etc. tasks
improvement for next experiment
(call egocentric processes stimulus-response processes)
