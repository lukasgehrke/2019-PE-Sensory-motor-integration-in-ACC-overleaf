              1992]. The MMN reflects the brain's ability to perform automatic
              comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an
              electrophysiological index of sensory learning and perceptual
              accuracy. Although the MMN has been studied extensively, the
              neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the MMN are not well
              understood. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain
              the generation of the MMN; amongst these accounts, the
              ``adaptation hypothesis'' and the ``model adjustment hypothesis''
              have received the most attention. This paper presents a review of

              auditory cortex continuously updates a generative model to
              predict its sensory inputs. The MMN is then modelled as the

              correlates of sense presence using electroencephalography (EEG)
              have reported mixed results. In the present study, we used brain
              event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by auditory stimuli to
              identify an objective physiological index of sense of presence
              during VR, attempting to replicate the findings of previous

              experience an immersive virtual environment using a modern
              head-mounted display while passively hearing task-irrelevant
              frequent standard and infrequent deviant tones as in a classic

               to extract stimulus relations within a sequence. Evidence from a
               variety of paradigms converges to show that the auditory system
               automatically uses stimulus predictability for facilitating its
               sequential processing. This type of predictive processing does
               not require attentional processing of the sounds or cognitive
               control of the predictions, nor does it involve the preparation
               of motor responses to the auditory stimuli. We will present a
               taxonomy of paradigms and resulting electrophysiological
               indicators for such automatic predictive processing in terms of
               event-related potential components and oscillatory activity.
               These indicators will include signals of fulfilled predictions
               (match signals such as N1 attenuation, repetition positivity,
               and early evoked gamma band response enhancement) as well as
               signals of violated predictions (mismatch signals such as the
               mismatch negativity and stimulus omission responses). We will
               show how recent approaches have revealed particularly early
               indicators of predictive processing down to the level of the
               auditory middle-latency responses. We will discuss the strength
               of the various indicators in terms of a truly predictive account
               of auditory processing (as opposed to, e.g., a retrospective
               verification of predictions). Finally, we will discuss the
               benefits of a predictive system within and beyond auditory
               processing. In conclusion, we argue in favor of the overwhelming
               evidence for predictions in audition, flexibly instantiated on
               different levels and timescales, and we aim to provide guidance

               one place or environment, even when one is physically situated
               in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness
               phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the
               interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors
               that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal

               Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors
               and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to
               measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive

               questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among

               However, when our brain's predictions about a planned action do
               not match the sensory inputs resulting from that action,
               cognitive conflict occurs. Much is known about cognitive
               conflict in 1D/2D environments; however, less is known about the
               role of movement characteristics associated with cognitive
               conflict in 3D environment. Hence, we devised an object

              it difficult for researchers to interpret, compare, and evaluate
              the presence ratings obtained from individual studies. Presence
              has been measured by employing questionnaires, physiological
              indices, behavioral feedbacks, and interviews. A systematic
              literature review was conducted to provide insight into the
              definitions and measurements of presence in studies from 2002 to
              2019, with a focus on questionnaires and physiological measures.
              The review showed that scholars had introduced various
              definitions of presence that often originate from different
              theoretical standpoints and that this has produced a multitude of
              different questionnaires that aim to measure presence. At the

               internal models that rely on visual and proprioceptive cues
               about the state of the hand. In active inference formulations of
               such models, the relative influence of each modality on action
               and perception is determined by how precise (reliable) it is
               expected to be. The 'top-down' affordance of expected precision
               to a particular sensory modality is associated with attention.
               Here, we asked whether increasing attention to (i.e., the
               precision of) vision or proprioception would enhance performance
               in a hand-target phase matching task, in which visual and
               proprioceptive cues about hand posture were incongruent. We show
               that in a simple simulated agent-based on predictive coding
               formulations of active inference-increasing the expected
               precision of vision or proprioception improved task performance
               (target matching with the seen or felt hand, respectively) under
               visuo-proprioceptive conflict. Moreover, we show that this
               formulation captured the behaviour and self-reported attentional
               allocation of human participants performing the same task in a
               virtual reality environment. Together, our results show that
               selective attention can balance the impact of (conflicting)

              weighted according to how (un)reliable-how precise-each
              respective modality is in a given context. However, perceptual
              experiments in other modalities suggest that the weights assigned
              to sensory cues are also modulated ``top-down'' by attention.
              Here, we asked whether during action, attention can likewise
              modulate the weights (i.e., precision) assigned to visual versus
              proprioceptive information about body position. Participants
              controlled a virtual hand (VH) via a data glove, matching either
              the VH or their (unseen) real hand (RH) movements to a target,
              and thus adopting a ``visual'' or ``proprioceptive'' attentional
              set, under varying levels of visuo-proprioceptive congruence and
              visibility. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed
              increased activation of the multisensory superior parietal lobe

               weighting them in proportion to their reliabilities. An emerging
               debate in neuroscience is to which extent multisensory
               integration emerges already in primary sensory areas or is
               deferred to higher-order association areas. This fMRI study used
               multivariate pattern decoding to characterize the computational
               principles that define how auditory and visual signals are
               integrated into spatial representations across the cortical
               hierarchy. Our results reveal small multisensory influences that
               were limited to a spatial window of integration in primary

               optimality. Intriguingly, audiovisual integration in parietal

               of spatial representations, whereas in parietal cortices, it

              these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under
              study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such
              interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an
              appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon
              who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most
              important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and
              associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with
              paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it
              is most important to accurately extract the neural processes
              specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but
              complementary objectives require different analysis methods.
              Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from
              the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a
              forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured
              data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general
              linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural
              information from data can be considered as backward models, as
              they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are
              multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters
              of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the
              sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at
              channels the activity of which is related to the brain process
              under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model
              parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or
              temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since
              significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the
              activity of which is statistically independent of the brain
              process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose
              a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models.
              This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of
              the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work

               strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability,
               but the neural basis of this computation remains poorly
               understood. We trained monkeys to perform a heading
               discrimination task from visual and vestibular cues, varying cue
               reliability randomly. The monkeys appropriately placed greater
               weight on the more reliable cue, and population decoding of
               neural responses in the dorsal medial superior temporal area
               closely predicted behavioral cue weighting, including modest
               deviations from optimality. We found that the mathematical
               combination of visual and vestibular inputs by single neurons is
               generally consistent with recent theories of optimal
               probabilistic computation in neural circuits. These results
               provide direct evidence for a neural mechanism mediating a
               simple and widespread form of statistical inference.",

              example, corticospinal projections originate in infragranular
              layers, are highly divergent and (along with descending
              cortico-cortical projections) target cells expressing NMDA
              receptors. This is somewhat paradoxical because backward
              modulatory characteristics would not be expected of driving motor
              command signals. We resolve this apparent paradox using a
              functional characterisation of the motor system based on
              Helmholtz's ideas about perception; namely, that perception is
              inference on the causes of visual sensations. We explain
              behaviour in terms of inference on the causes of proprioceptive

              which higher cortical levels send descending proprioceptive

              perceptual inference in sensory cortex, where descending
              connections convey predictions, while ascending connections
              convey prediction errors. The anatomical substrate of this

              between the predicted and actual visual consequences of the
              movement). One reason for this is that PEs tend to be associated
              with task errors, as well as changes in motor output and visual
              input, making them difficult to isolate. Here this issue is
              addressed using electroencephalography. A strategy (STR)
              condition, in which participants were instructed on how to
              counter a 45° visuomotor rotation, was compared to a condition in
              which participants had adapted to the rotation (POST). Both
              conditions were matched for task errors and movement kinematics,
              with the only difference being the presence of PEs in STR.

  abstract  = "Neural oscillations are thought to provide a cyclic time frame
               for orchestrating brain computations. Following this assumption,
               midfrontal theta oscillations have recently been proposed to
               temporally organize brain computations during conflict
               processing. Using a multivariate analysis approach, we show that
               brain-behavior relationships during conflict tasks are modulated
               according to the phase of ongoing endogenous midfrontal theta
               oscillations recorded by scalp EEG. We found reproducible
               results in two independent datasets, using two different
               conflict tasks: brain-behavior relationships (correlation
               between reaction time and theta power) were theta
               phase-dependent in a subject-specific manner, and these
               ``behaviorally optimal'' theta phases were also associated with
               fronto-parietal cross-frequency dynamics emerging as theta
               phase-locked beta power bursts. These effects were present
               regardless of the strength of conflict. Thus, these results
               provide empirical evidence that midfrontal theta oscillations
               are involved in cyclically orchestrating brain computations
               likely related to response execution during the tasks rather
               than purely related to conflict processing. More generally, this

              embodied agents, like ourselves, as satisfying basic imperatives
              for sustained exchanges with the environment. In brief, one
              simple driving force appears to explain many aspects of
              perception, action and the perception of action. This driving
              force is the minimisation of surprise or prediction error,
              which--in the context of perception--corresponds to Bayes-optimal
              predictive coding (that suppresses exteroceptive prediction
              errors) and--in the context of action--reduces to classical motor
              reflexes (that suppress proprioceptive prediction errors). In
              what follows, we look at some of the phenomena that emerge from
              this single principle, such as the perceptual encoding of spatial
              trajectories that can both generate movement (of self) and

              avoid surprising states of the world, it is necessary to minimise

  abstract = "In this paper, I address the question as to why participants tend
              to respond realistically to situations and events portrayed
              within an immersive virtual reality system. The idea is put
              forward, based on the experience of a large number of
              experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components
              that contribute to this realistic response. The first is 'being
              there', often called 'presence', the qualia of having a sensation
              of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI).
              Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that
              the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of
              both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not
              'there' and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained
              by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality
              system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can
              produce events that directly relate to the participant, the
              overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison
              with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur,
              participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In recent years, analyses of event related
               potentials/fields have moved from the selection of a few
               components and peaks to a mass-univariate approach in which the
               whole data space is analyzed. Such extensive testing increases
               the number of false positives and correction for multiple
               comparisons is needed. METHOD: Here we review all cluster-based
               correction for multiple comparison methods (cluster-height,
               cluster-size, cluster-mass, and threshold free cluster
               enhancement - TFCE), in conjunction with two computational
               approaches (permutation and bootstrap). RESULTS: Data driven
               Monte-Carlo simulations comparing two conditions within subjects
               (two sample Student's t-test) showed that, on average, all
               cluster-based methods using permutation or bootstrap alike
               control well the family-wise error rate (FWER), with a few
               caveats. CONCLUSIONS: (i) A minimum of 800 iterations are
               necessary to obtain stable results; (ii) below 50 trials,
               bootstrap methods are too conservative; (iii) for low critical
               family-wise error rates (e.g. p=1\%), permutations can be too
               liberal; (iv) TFCE controls best the type 1 error rate with an

              neural mechanisms involved in spatial conflict processing. Human
              subjects performed a Simon task, in which conflict was induced by
              incongruence between spatial location and response hand. We found
              an early (∼200 ms post-stimulus) conflict modulation in
              stimulus-contralateral parietal gamma (30-50 Hz), followed by a
              later alpha-band (8-12 Hz) conflict modulation, suggesting an
              early detection of spatial conflict and inhibition of spatial
              location processing. Inter-regional connectivity analyses
              assessed via cross-frequency coupling of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha,
              and gamma power revealed conflict-induced shifts in cortical
              network interactions: Congruent trials (relative to incongruent
              trials) had stronger coupling between frontal theta and
              stimulus-contrahemifield parietal alpha/gamma power, whereas
              incongruent trials had increased theta coupling between medial
              frontal and lateral frontal regions. These findings shed new

              behavioral and experimental dynamics, and many indices of brain
              activity, that vary from trial to trial. For example, in studies
              of response conflict, conflict is usually treated as a binary
              variable (i.e., response conflict exists or does not in any given
              trial), whereas some evidence and intuition suggests that
              conflict may vary in intensity from trial to trial. Here we
              demonstrate that single-trial multiple regression of
              time-frequency electrophysiological activity reveals neural
              mechanisms of cognitive control that are not apparent in
              cross-trial averages. We also introduce a novel extension to
              oscillation phase coherence and synchronization analyses, based
              on ``weighted'' phase modulation, that has advantages over
              standard coherence measures in terms of linking
              electrophysiological dynamics to trial-varying behavior and
              experimental variables. After replicating previous response
              conflict findings using trial-averaged data, we extend these
              findings using single-trial analytic methods to provide novel
              evidence for the role of medial frontal-lateral prefrontal
              theta-band synchronization in conflict-induced response time
              dynamics, including a role for lateral prefrontal theta-band
              activity in biasing response times according to perceptual

              By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated

              the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce

              the data, particularly for computations done in single precision.
              We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the

              the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels

              the results of our motor actions in an ever-changing environment.
              Our cognitive processes and supporting brain dynamics are
              inherently coupled both to our environment and to our physical
              structure and actions. To investigate human cognition in its most
              natural forms demands imaging of brain activity while
              participants perform naturally motivated actions and interactions
              within a full three-dimensional environment. Transient,
              distributed brain activity patterns supporting spontaneous motor
              actions, performed in pursuit of naturally motivated goals, may
              involve any or all parts of cortex and must be precisely timed at
              a speed faster than the speed of thought and action. Hemodynamic
              imaging methods give information about brain dynamics on a much
              slower scale, and established techniques for imaging brain
              dynamics in all modalities forbid participants from making
              natural extensive movements so as to avoid intractable
              movement-related artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we are
              developing mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approaches to study
              natural human cognition. By synchronizing lightweight,
              high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recording with
              recordings of participant sensory experience, body and eye
              movements, and other physiological measures, we can apply

              dynamics accompanying active human cognition in its most natural

              goal-oriented control of a computer system without any form of
              explicit communication from the human operator. Instead, the
              system generated the necessary input itself, based on real-time
              analysis of brain activity. Specific brain responses were evoked
              by violating the operators' expectations to varying degrees. The
              evoked brain activity demonstrated detectable differences
              reflecting congruency with or deviations from the operators'

              build a user model of those expectations, thus representing the
              optimal (expected) state as perceived by the operator. Based on
              this model, which was continuously updated, the computer
              automatically adapted itself to the expectations of its operator.
              Further analyses showed this evoked activity to originate from
              the medial prefrontal cortex and to exhibit a linear
              correspondence to the degree of expectation violation. These

  abstract    = "SummaryThe retrosplenial complex (RSC) plays a crucial role in
                 spatial orientation by computing heading direction and
                 translating between distinct spatial reference frames. While
                 invasive studies allow investigating heading computation in
                 moving animals, established non-invasive analyses of human
                 brain dynamics are restricted to stationary setups. To
                 investigate the role of the RSC in heading computation of
                 actively moving humans, we used a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging
                 approach synchronizing electroencephalography with motion
                 capture and virtual reality. Data from physically rotating
                 participants were contrasted with rotations based only on
                 visual flow. Varying rotation velocities were accompanied by
                 pronounced beta synchronization during physical rotation. In
                 addition, heading computation based only on visual flow
                 replicated alpha desynchronization in the RSC, which was
                 absent during physical rotation. These results suggest an
                 involvement of the human RSC in heading computation based on
                 vestibular input and implicate revisiting traditional findings
                 of alpha desynchronization during spatial orientation in
                 movement-restricted participants.Heading computation is
                 fundamental for spatial orientation in the human and other
                 species. The registration of moment-to-moment changes in
                 orientation with respect to an allocentric reference direction
                 provides information about an animal's current heading
                 relative to the environment. This is accomplished by the
                 integration of vestibular, proprioceptive, and visual signals
                 providing information about linear and angular velocity
                 signals of the head, the relative position of the head with
                 respect to the trunk, and information about stable aspects of
                 the environment, respectively.1 Single cell recordings in
                 freely behaving animals identified several brain structures
                 involved in heading computation, including the retrosplenial
                 cortex (RSC).2, 3 The RSC receives input from the visual
                 system and from head direction cells in the thalamic nuclei.4
                 It also hosts subpopulations of heading-sensitive cells that
                 are sentient to local features of the environment, while other
                 cells exhibit mixed activity patterns related to both local
                 and global heading computation.5 These findings suggest that
                 neural activity in the RSC subserves the integration of
                 information about the local and global environment,
                 integrating egocentrically coded landmark cues based on
                 sensory fusion (vision and proprioception)6 with allocentric
                 heading information originating from the Papez circuit.7 This
                 allows the compensation of the rotational offset between
                 egocentric and allocentric spatial representations, routed
                 from the parietal and medial temporal cortices, providing the
                 necessary information for translating between both egocentric
                 and allocentric spatial representational frames in the RSC.8",

  abstract = "The electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, minimally
              restrictive, and relatively low-cost measure of mesoscale brain
              dynamics with high temporal resolution. Although signals recorded
              in parallel by multiple, near-adjacent EEG scalp electrode
              channels are highly-correlated and combine signals from many
              different sources, biological and non-biological, independent
              component analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the various
              source generator processes underlying those recordings.
              Independent components (IC) found by ICA decomposition can be
              manually inspected, selected, and interpreted, but doing so
              requires both time and practice as ICs have no order or intrinsic
              interpretations and therefore require further study of their
              properties. Alternatively, sufficiently-accurate automated IC
              classifiers can be used to classify ICs into broad source
              categories, speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many
              subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition in
              near-real-time applications. While many such classifiers have
              been proposed recently, this work presents the ICLabel project
              comprised of (1) the ICLabel dataset containing spatiotemporal
              measures for over 200,000 ICs from more than 6000 EEG recordings
              and matching component labels for over 6000 of those ICs, all
              using common average reference, (2) the ICLabel website for
              collecting crowdsourced IC labels and educating EEG researchers
              and practitioners about IC interpretation, and (3) the automated
              ICLabel classifier, freely available for MATLAB. The ICLabel
              classifier improves upon existing methods in two ways: by
              improving the accuracy of the computed label estimates and by
              enhancing its computational efficiency. The classifier
              outperforms or performs comparably to the previous best publicly
              available automated IC component classification method for all
              measured IC categories while computing those labels ten times
              faster than that classifier as shown by a systematic comparison
              against other publicly available EEG IC classifiers.",

  abstract = "Brain function can be conceived as a hierarchy of generative
              models that optimizes predictions of sensory inputs and minimizes
              ``surprise.'' Each level of the hierarchy makes predictions of
              neural events at a lower level in the hierarchy, which returns a
              prediction error when these expectations are violated. We tested
              the generalization of this hypothesis to multiple sequential
              deviations, and we identified the most likely organization of the
              network that accommodates deviations in temporal structure of
              stimuli. Magnetoencephalography of healthy human participants
              during an auditory paradigm identified prediction error responses
              in bilateral primary auditory cortex, superior temporal gyrus,
              and lateral prefrontal cortex for deviation by frequency,
              intensity, location, duration, and silent gap. We examined the
              connectivity between cortical sources using a set of 21
              generative models that embedded alternate hypotheses of
              frontotemporal network dynamics. Bayesian model selection
              provided evidence for two new features of functional network
              organization. First, an expectancy signal provided input to the
              prefrontal cortex bilaterally, related to the temporal structure
              of stimuli. Second, there are functionally significant lateral
              connections between superior temporal and/or prefrontal cortex.
              The results support a predictive coding hypothesis but go beyond
              previous work in demonstrating the generalization to multiple
              concurrent stimulus dimensions and the evidence for a temporal
              expectancy input at the higher level of the frontotemporal
              hierarchy. We propose that this framework for studying the
              brain's response to unexpected events is not limited to simple
              sensory tasks but may also apply to the neurocognitive mechanisms
              of higher cognitive functions and their disorders.",

  abstract = "One of the most firmly established factors determining the speed
              of human behavioral responses toward action-critical stimuli is
              the spatial correspondence between the stimulus and response
              locations. If both locations match, the time taken for response
              production is markedly reduced relative to when they mismatch, a
              phenomenon called the Simon effect. While there is a consensus
              that this stimulus-response (S-R) conflict is associated with
              brief (4-7 Hz) frontal midline theta (fm$\vartheta$) complexes
              generated in medial frontal cortex, it remains controversial (1)
              whether there are multiple, simultaneously active theta generator
              areas in the medial frontal cortex that commonly give rise to
              conflict-related fm$\vartheta$ complexes; and if so, (2) whether
              they are all related to the resolution of conflicting task
              information. Here, we combined mental chronometry with
              high-density electroencephalographic measures during a Simon-type
              manual reaching task and used independent component analysis and
              time-frequency domain statistics on source-level activities to
              model fm$\vartheta$ sources. During target processing, our
              results revealed two independent fm$\vartheta$ generators
              simultaneously active in or near anterior cingulate cortex, only
              one of them reflecting the correspondence between current and
              previous S-R locations. However, this fm$\vartheta$ response is
              not exclusively linked to conflict but also to other,
              conflict-independent processes associated with response slowing.
              These results paint a detailed picture regarding the oscillatory
              correlates of conflict processing in Simon tasks, and challenge
              the prevalent notion that fm$\vartheta$ complexes induced by
              conflicting task information represent a unitary phenomenon
              related to cognitive control, which governs conflict processing
              across various types of response-override tasks.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT Humans constantly monitor their environment for and
              adjust their cognitive control settings in response to conflicts,
              an ability that arguably paves the way for survival in
              ever-changing situations. Anterior cingulate-generated frontal
              midline theta (fm$\vartheta$) complexes have been hypothesized to
              play a role in this conflict-monitoring function. However, it
              remains a point of contention whether fm$\vartheta$ complexes
              govern conflict processing in a unitary, paradigm-nonspecific
              manner. Here, we identified two independent fm$\vartheta$
              oscillations triggered during a Simon-type task, only one of them
              reflecting current and previous conflicts. Importantly, this
              signal differed in various respects (cortical origin, intertrial
              history) from fm$\vartheta$ phenomena in other response-override
              tasks, challenging the prevalent notion of conflict-induced
              fm$\vartheta$ as a unitary phenomenon associated with the
              resolution of conflict.",

  author   = "Krol, Laurens R and Haselager, Pim and Zander, Thorsten O",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The interpretation of neurophysiological measurements
              has a decades-long history, culminating in current real-time
              brain-computer interfacing (BCI) applications for both patient
              and healthy populations. Over the course of this history, one
              focus has been on the investigation of cortical responses to
              specific stimuli. Such responses can be informative with respect
              to the human user's mental state at the time of presentation. An
              ability to decode neurophysiological responses to stimuli in real
              time becomes particularly powerful when combined with a
              simultaneous ability to autonomously produce such stimuli. This
              allows a computer to gather stimulus-response samples and
              iteratively produce new stimuli based on the information gathered
              from previous samples, thus acquiring more, and more specific,
              information. This information can even be obtained without the
              explicit, voluntary involvement of the user. APPROACH: We define
              cognitive and affective probing, referring to an application of
              active learning where repeated sampling is done by eliciting
              implicit brain responses. In this tutorial, we provide a
              definition of this method that unifies different past and current
              implementations based on common aspects. We then discuss a number
              of aspects that differentiate various possible implementations of
              cognitive probing. MAIN RESULTS: We argue that a key element is
              the user model, which serves as both information storage and
              basis for subsequent probes. Cognitive probing can be used to
              continuously and autonomously update this model, refining the
              probes, and obtaining increasingly detailed or accurate
              information from the resulting brain activity. In contrast to a
              number of potential advantages of the method, cognitive probing
              may also pose a threat to informed consent, our privacy of
              thought, and our ability to assign responsibility to actions
              mediated by the system. SIGNIFICANCE: This tutorial provides
              guidelines to both implement, and critically discuss potential
              ethical implications of, novel cognitive probing applications and
              research endeavours.",

              studied using response selection tasks. In these tasks, involving
              very simple motor responses (e.g., button press), errors concern
              inappropriate action-selection only. However, EEG activity in
              relation to inaccurate movement-execution in more complex motor
              tasks has been much less examined. In the present study, we
              recorded EEG while volunteers performed reaching movements in a
              force-field created by a robotic device. Hand-path deviations
              were induced by interspersing catch trials in which the force
              condition was unpredictably altered. Our goal was twofold. First,
              we wanted to determine whether a frontocentral ERP was elicited
              by sensory-prediction errors, whose amplitude reflected the size
              of kinematic errors. Then, we explored whether common neural
              processes could be involved in the generation of this ERP and the
              feedback-related negativity (FRN), often assumed to reflect
              reward-prediction errors. We identified a frontocentral

              similarities in terms of time course, topography, and potential

              constrain associative learning, determining which stimuli can
              enter into association, as well as the functional form of that
              association. Bayesian learning theory provides one mechanism by
              which structural beliefs can be acquired from experience, but the
              neural basis of this mechanism is poorly understood. We studied
              this question with a combination of behavioral, computational,
              and neuroimaging techniques. Male and female human subjects
              learned to predict an outcome based on cue and context stimuli
              while being scanned using fMRI. Using a model-based analysis of
              the fMRI data, we show that structure learning signals are
              encoded in posterior parietal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex,
              and the frontal pole. These structure learning signals are
              distinct from associative learning signals. Moreover,
              representational similarity analysis and information mapping
              revealed that the multivariate patterns of activity in posterior
              parietal cortex and anterior insula encode the full posterior

              of the posterior across subjects predicted variability in their
              subsequent behavioral performance. These results provide evidence

              to infer the hidden structure behind causal relations between
              stimuli in the environment, allowing them to generalize this
              knowledge to stimuli they have never experienced before. A
              recently published computational model based on this idea
              provided a parsimonious account of a wide range of phenomena
              reported in the animal learning literature, suggesting a
              dedicated neural mechanism for learning this hidden structure.
              Here, we validate this model by measuring brain activity during a
              task that involves both structure learning and associative
              learning. We show that a distinct network of regions supports

               control but does not strictly reflect the specific use of
               control. In this study, we assessed frontal theta responses that
               underpinned the switch cost in task switching - a specific index
               of cognitive control that does not rely exclusively on RT
               slowing. Here, we utilised a single-trial regression approach to
               assess 1) how cognitive control demands beyond simple RT slowing
               were linked to midfrontal theta and 2) whether midfrontal theta
               effects remained stable over time. In a large cohort that
               included a longitudinal subsample, we found that midfrontal
               theta was modulated by switch costs, with enhanced theta power
               when preparing to switch vs. repeating a task. These effects
               were reliable after a two-year interval (Cronbach's
               $\alpha$.39-0.74). In contrast, we found that trial-by-trial
               modulations of midfrontal theta power predicted the size of the
               switch cost - so that switch trials with increased theta

              Neuronal post-error adaptations comprise activity increase in

              unexpected tactile sensations can herald events of motivational

              hedonic rewards (e.g., a caressing touch). Awareness of such

              body-related mismatch responses by the anterior insula. To
              investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using

              comparing their ability to explain trial-by-trial changes in MMN

               investigate the effects of tactile, olfactory, audio and visual
               sensory cues on a participant's sense of presence in a virtual
               environment and on their memory for the environment and the
               objects in that environment. Results strongly indicate that
               increasing the modalities of sensory input in a virtual
               environment can increase both the sense of presence and memory
               for objects in the environment. In particular, the addition of
               tactile, olfactory and auditory cues to a virtual environment
               increased the user's sense of presence and memory of the
               environment. Surprisingly, increasing the level of visual detail
               did not result in an increase in the user's sense of presence or
               memory of the environment.",

  author   = "Xue, Jing-Hao and Hall, Peter",
  abstract = "Many established classifiers fail to identify the minority class
              when it is much smaller than the majority class. To tackle this
              problem, researchers often first rebalance the class sizes in the
              training dataset, through oversampling the minority class or
              undersampling the majority class, and then use the rebalanced
              data to train the classifiers. This leads to interesting
              empirical patterns. In particular, using the rebalanced training
              data can often improve the area under the receiver operating
              characteristic curve (AUC) for the original, unbalanced test
              data. The AUC is a widely-used quantitative measure of
              classification performance, but the property that it increases
              with rebalancing has, as yet, no theoretical explanation. In this
              note, using Gaussian-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as
              the classifier, we demonstrate that, at least for LDA, there is
              an intrinsic, positive relationship between the rebalancing of
              class sizes and the improvement of AUC. We show that the largest
              improvement of AUC is achieved, asymptotically, when the two
              classes are fully rebalanced to be of equal sizes.",

              many bio-behavioral functions impaired in schizophrenia.
              Furthermore, its total volume has been shown to be reduced in
              schizophrenia. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis
              that in schizophrenia it is the anterior insular lobule
              (aINS(lbl)) rather than the posterior insular lobule (pINS(lbl))
              that is smaller, given that limbic system abnormalities are
              central in schizophrenia and that the affiliations of the limbic
              system are principally with the anterior insular lobule. We used
              T1-weighted high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
              measure the cortical volume of the left and right anterior and
              posterior insular subdivisions. The subjects included a sample of
              healthy community controls (N=40) and chronic patients with
              DSM-III-R schizophrenia (N=41). We correlated insula volumes with
              positive and negative symptoms. We found that the total
              aINS(lbl), and the left aINS(lbl) in particular, were
              significantly volumetrically smaller in schizophrenia compared to
              controls, and significantly correlated with bizarre behavior.
              Given that the anterior insular lobule offers anatomic features
              that allow for MRI-based morphometric analysis, namely its
              central and circular sulci, this brain structure provides a
              useful model to test hypotheses regarding genotype-phenotype
              relationships in schizophrenia using the anterior insular lobule
              as a candidate endophenotype.",
